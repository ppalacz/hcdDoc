== Context

This section describes the following key elements/practices of modern testing process for sizeable software systems:

* Testing many kinds of artifacts - rather than one (most often, the UI)
* Mechanizing Testing - rather than relying on manual testing
* Integrating Testing with Continuous Integration - rather than treating it as an activity separated from the development and environment promotions
* Adopting Testing Progression: starting with the simplest tests and proceeding to the most complex ones, if the simpler tests succeed, and stopping on failure - rather than waving defects and failures through.
