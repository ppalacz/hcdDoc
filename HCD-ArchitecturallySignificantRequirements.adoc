== Overview

This document discusses _Architecturally Significant Requirements_ (further abbreviated as _ASRs_) as identified in the RFI documentation being worked on at HCD at the time of writing:

* RFI # 21-ITB-001 that provides "mid-level" requirements for a case management system pertaining to house element compliance and to violations of state housing planning law (see << Requirements for RFI #21-ITB-001 >>)

* RFI # 21-ITB-002 that provides "mid-level" requirements for a potential replacement for the current CASAS system (in its two parts, internal and external-facing, see << Requirements for RFI #21-ITB-002 >>)

The document also provides applicable background for identifying ASRs and more broadly, analyzing requirements (see section <<Terminology and Approach>>)

== Motivation and Goals

Requirements are not created equal - some of them have bigger impact on the target solution than others. Some of the impactful requirements affect the way the target system is to be organized - that is, they affect its architecture or at least constraints on that architecture. 


 
=== Main Sections

. The section << Terminology and Approach >> provides a minimal background for analyzing Requirements and for identifying ASRs.

. The section  << ASRs in HCD RFIs >> discusses Architecturally Significant Requirements that are common to the RFIs being worked in HCD. It also points out differences and variations in identified requirements as presented in respective RFIs.

. The section << Next Steps >> suggests further steps that might be taken with respect to ASRs and handling of Requirements in HCD's RFIs in general.

. The section << Requirements for RFI #21-ITB-001 >> provides further discussion of the requirements in RFI #21-ITB-001  

. The section << Requirements for RFI #21-ITB-002 >> does the same for RFI #21-ITB-002.
